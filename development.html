        The idea behind this was to solve a problem regarding a lack of information for first years coming into Brown University. Often, first years are
        assigned dorm housing but have no idea what those dorms might look like, their location, amongst other details. My intent was to create an application
        that would host images of these dorms along with features unique to them. The application would enable a user to sort based on conditions such as 
        <b>year built</b> and <b>Average square footage of rooms</b>. Also, a user could filter out options based on <b>location</b> and <b>bathroom style</b>.

    <h3>Structure</h3>
  </div>
    <p>For this project, I utilized React and Javascript to build out the application. React was especially useful due to the nature of the applcation being 
      one that would need to be changed and updated based on a user input. The Application is dynamic and React supports this. 
    
    The underlying structure of the application is built using Javascript. I'd like to highlight the use of Components in this project. 
  I utilized two specific Components: <ul>HousingItem Component</ul> <ul>CartItem Component</ul> These two components were used to build out each individual item display as seen below<br><br>
  <div id = "images">
  <img  id="images" src="source/dorm-display.png" width="300px" height="400px"> 
  <img  id="images" src="source/dorm-display-1.png" width="300px" height="400px"> 
  </div>
  <figcaption><b>HousingItem Display</b></figcaption>
  <br>

 
  <b>Specifics:</b> A dataset is mapped over using the Components as a template to be built into. Details such as Location, Average Square Footage, Bathroom Type, Year built are all extracted from 
  dataset. <br>
  <b>HousingItem Component</b> represents the component for every dorm card displayed on the page. The HousingItem card displays data like the Location, Average Square Footage, Bathroom Type, Year built. 
  Each card features a save button which adds each dorm to a <b>saved</b> section where a user can process them later on. <br>
  <b>CartItem Component</b> represents the component that stores all saved dorm card displayed on the page. The CartItem is displayed towards the bottom of the page and updates by either
  the user clicking the save button or the user directly changing the count in the cart. The idea of the count in the cart is that a user can see how popular a dorm is based on how many times it has been saved
  to the cart. The cartItem component also includes a clear cart item option that will remove all saved Dorms instantly. <br> <br>

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
  </div>
  <p>I'd also like to touch on the filtering and sorting operations of the application. I chose to implement these using radio button for the sort by and checkboxes for the filtering.
    The use of radio buttons restricts the sorting choice to just one at a time: Users can sort by either avg square footage or year built. 
    The use of checkboxes actually allows filters to be stacked upon each other; Users can adopt custom filter combinations to acheive their desired result.

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Throughout this project, I was able to dive deeper into react and its nuances. I also learned how to piece together a responsive website which I definitely enjoyed
      I also got a feel for how to use states to achieve the constant updating that comes with a responsive website.
