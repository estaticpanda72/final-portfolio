          <h3> Background</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          <br>
         The intent for this project was to reimagine a startup. Reimagagining a startup involved simply reading through the mission/objective of a startup
         , avoiding looking at the current product and then proceeding to design an interface that accomplishes the intent of said startup. Once again working as part of a group, 
         I chose to tackle Slai, a machine learning startup. Slai is a prototyping platform for machine learning development. They provide a self-serve service for developers to build and ship models from their browser, 
         and publish sandboxes that anyone can use.
        </p>

          <h3> The Process</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          <br>
          The first step in this process was creating rough sketches to use as a basis for both lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes. Each member of our 4 person team crafted a couple sketches of what Slai could look like. 
          We included pages such as a <b>homepage, editor page, template page, and Setting page</b>. Please take a look at the images below
          <div id = "images">
            <img  id="images" src="source/sketches-1.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
            <img  id="images" src="source/sketches-2.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
            <br>
            <img  id="images" src="source/sketches-3.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
            </div>
            <br>
            <figcaption><b>Initial Sketches</b></figcaption>

            After this, we combined elements from each person's individual sketch to create low fidelity prototypes. Please take a look at the images below.
            <div id = "images">
              <img  id="images" src="source/lofi 1.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
              <img  id="images" src="source/lofi 2.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
              <img  id="images" src="source/lofi 3.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
              </div>
              <br>
              <figcaption><b>Lo-Fi Prototype</b></figcaption>
              <br>

              A key part of the high fidelity process was being able to gain feedback about our initial prototype and use that feedback to develop an iteration upon our design.

              <li>Begin editing with a Decision Tree template.</li>

          <p class="card-text">The response to our second task indicates that we should have kept template selection on its own page, contrary to the feedback we received in the crit studio. This was unexpcted. Moving forward, we believe that keeping things modular here would be best for learnability.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Finally, the results of our last task fell in line with our expectations, as we made it incredibly easy to reach the "About" page.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Overall, we believe that just a few interface changes regarding the interactive components of our prototype should be changed to be a bit more obvious that they are interactive.</p>

        <p>
          <br>
          This team project was one I enjoyed primarily due to the full outlet for creativity as far as being able to take this webpage in whatever direction I wanted. 
          I think being able to go through the full design process of sketching, then prototyping, then reiterating after gainin feedback was incredibly exciting. We did reach out to the actual Slai founders to get their 
          feedback on our mockup. Ultimately they were pleased with the result!
