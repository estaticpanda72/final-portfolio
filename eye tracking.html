          Hello there! Let's talk a bit about the idea behind the eyetracking experience. 
          This was the first project I tackled as part of a group of designers. It all began with an initial bakery webpage design. Using this as a starting point, my group split into two 
          groups to create two versions. 
          This involved adding photos, changing the size, typeface, and layout of text, drastically changing the color scheme, adding content, etc.
          My group decided to make one version pretty wild and eyecatching with mismatched fonts, bright colors, and unaligned images; the other version would the polar opposite.
          This was done with the intent of being able to observe how much eye tracking data would differ across the two versions.
          Our hypothesis was that the more disjunct version would result in much more varied eye tracking fata

        <div id = "Header">
          <h3> Details</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Below are the figma mockups of the redesigned bakery pages
        </p>
      <div id = "images">
        <img  id="images" src="source/eye-tracking-1.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
        <img  id="images" src="source/eye-tracking-2.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
        </div>
        
        <figcaption><b>The 2 versions</b></figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>Following the redesign process and setting our hypothese, We invited a 3 test subjects to participate in our experiment.
          These subjects were hooked up to an eye tracker system and asked to interact with the page for a couple seconds. Below are images of what the results were. 
          <div id = "images">
            <img  id="images" src="source/simple-heat.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
            <img  id="images" src="source/simple-track.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
            </div>
            <figcaption><b>Version A: Heat Tracking and Eye Tracking Result</b></figcaption>
            <br>
            <div id = "images">
              <img  id="images" src="source/complex-heat.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
              <img  id="images" src="source/complex-track.png" width="450px" height="400px"> 
              </div>
              <figcaption><b>Version B: Heat Tracking and Eye Tracking Result</b></figcaption>
              <br>
            NOTE: 
            In both of the graphs, a large portion of viewers' time were concentrated on the images. This is to be expected as images are the most visually attractive in any interface. However, it's worth noting how much attention viewers 
            gave to the images from version B compared to Version A. Barely much attention was spent on the aspects of the page that would actually enable the user to perform actions such as adding to cart or navigating to another aspect of the 
            page. This works against the intent of a bakery page having a consistent mental model. Usability also declines if too much attention is drawn away from the features of the interface as well. 
            In addition, the effectiveness of conveying important information such as the bakery address is affected. Notice how viewers eyes' glance at the address featured on version A compared to not even a single glance on version B.
            While this could be attributed to the software not catching all eye activity, I think it's something that should not be completely explained away. A webpage that has too much going on expectedly distracts a user.

        <p>
          <br>
          Following this project, I got a better appreciation for the attention to detail that goes into designing an interface. There is quite a bit to the accounted for. 
          The tradeoffs between being super creative vs super practical is one that must be navigated carefully. As this experiment shows, leaning too far in one direction results in 
          loss of impact from the other end.
